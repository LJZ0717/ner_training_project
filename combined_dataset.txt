The O

has O
not O

such O

its O

Thus O
the O
POLG O

mutation O
may O
be O
a O

of O

due O
to O

A O

can O
not O
be O

suggesting O
the O
possibility O

However O
whether O

A O
43 B-AGE_ONSET

The O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
camptocormia O
in O
our O
patient O
was O
parkinsonism O
itself O
as O

the O

Furthermore O
the O
