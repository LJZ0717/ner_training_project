The patient presented with history of moderate cytochrome c oxidase-negative muscle fibers, acute elevated circulating hepatic transaminase concentration manifestation, adult onset detected. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant c.1399G>A p.Ala467Thr and c.2542G>A p.Gly848Ser. Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
The patient presented with presence of persistent adult onset. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant Tyr955Cys. Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
The patient presented with presence of severe elevated circulating hepatic transaminase concentration. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant p.Arg1096His (c.3287G>A) and p.Arg953Cys (c.2857C>T). Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
The patient presented with history of persistent cytochrome c oxidase-negative muscle fibers, history of chronic adult onset, clinical signs of persistent seizure. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant c.3311C>G (p.S1104C) and c.2542G>A (p.G848S). Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
The patient presented with history of chronic dysarthria. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant c.3102delG (p.Lys1035Serfs*59) and c.3286C>T (p.Arg1096Cys). Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
The patient presented with diagnosed with episodic adult onset, diagnosed with severe dysarthria, mild elevated circulating hepatic transaminase concentration, intermittent seizure observed. Subsequent genetic testing revealed gene variant c.1399G>A p.Ala467Thr and c.3626_3629dupGATA. Over the past few months, the symptoms have evolved, prompting the clinical team to initiate targeted therapy and recommend ongoing monitoring.
