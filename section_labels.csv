"The hetero compound mutations in POLG were not found in either of the 1000 Genomes Project Database, ESP6500 database nor HGVD, suggesting that these are pathogenic mutations. The amino acid sequences of these two sites (p.A957V and p.I1185T) are well conserved across species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating their importance (Fig. 3). In silico analyses also predicted that these two amino acid mutations are deleterious. Furthermore A957V has been reported by Tang et al. [10]. They reported A957V allele was shared in three unrelated patients and concluded this mutation is pathogenic. The pathogenic mutations in the ﬂanking region of p.1185I; p.1184D [11,12] and p.1186D [13] have been reported, suggesting this region is also important. Thus, we conclude the compound heterozygous mutations of this patient cause the disease. Alpers syndrome is deﬁned as the clinical triad of (1) refractory, mixed-type seizures that often include a focal component, (2) psychomotor regression, often triggered by intercurrent infection, and (3) hepatopathy with or without acute liver failure. There is an overlap between the phenotypes of MCHS and Alpers syndrome; however, the former usually shows an earlier onset age and more rapid disease progression, while the latter is characterized by intractable epilepsy. Using the “myo-” preﬁx in MCHS may be confusing since the pathological ﬁndings of muscles in this disorder often shows no evidence of mitochondrial myopathy; instead, the hypotonia observed in the triad can be regarded as a symptom of brain dysfunction. Thus, the clinical features of the",

With exception of ataxia and myoclonus, movement disorders are not typical features of POLG1 associated disorders. We report on two affected siblings compound heterozygous for A467T and W748S mutations, one suffering from choreoathetosis and apraxia of lid opening due to focal eyelid dystonia that mimicked progression of ptosis, resulting in functional blindness. So far, focal dystonia has not been reported in POLG1 mutation carriers, and should be considered when investigating patients with PEO and ptosis.

"Mutations in the POLG gene are an uncommon, but important, cause of movement disorders. Our case demonstrates typical features of MSCAE: adolescent-onset ataxia, myoclonus, migraine, epilepsy, and neuropathy. External ophthalmoplegia and ptosis are reported in MSCAE and other POLG mutations, but tend to occur later.3 Severe liver disease can occur secondary to valproate treatment.4 Our patient’s tremor and cerebellar signs are possibly explained by cerebellar and thalamic involvement seen on MRI. However, the pathophysiology-MRI correlate of dystonia is not clear; it is also possible that other normal-appearing tissue is involved.",0.0
"The molecular genetic analysis identified two previously undescribed mutations located in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit (a subunit) of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase 'Y (POLG). These mutations are assumed to be pathogenic because they are not reported as polymorphic changes, are absent from more than 400 control alleles and can change highly conserved amino acids. The leucine residue at codon 623 is located in a highly conserved region in vertebrates (Fig. 2B) and includes another pathogenic POLG1 mutation, namely R627W [26]. The region containing the lysine residue at codon 755 is also conserved in drosophila (Fig. 2B) and includes the pathogenic F749S POLG1 mutation [27].",1.0

"Of 42 consecutive patients with dystonia who underwent GPi-DBS implantation at University of Pe´cs,6 4 patients had limited response 6–12 months after implantation. They received Activa RC generator (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), which was programmed according to the guidance of the German multicenter trial1: Brieﬂy, those contacts were chosen for single monopolar stimulation where the largest acute reduction of dystonic hyperkinesia was achieved or phosphenes were elicited or the postoperative brain scans suggested the most optimal position. We applied stable frequency (130 Hz) and pulse width (120 ls) values, whereas amplitude was programmed to the submaximal value (0.5 V below the threshold of inducing acute adverse effects). Because the beneﬁcial effects of GPiDBS may have a protracted appearance, these settings remained unchanged for 6–9 months. In these 4 cases we detected <25% improvement on DRS; therefore, we switched to the monopolar stimulation of an adjacent contact using its submaximal amplitude value without further beneﬁt. Subsequently, double monopolar stimulation mode was also tried without any improvements. Finally, we",0.0

"cox-positive liver cells. This quantitative analysis correlated well with the results obtained by in situ hybridization of mtDNA. Interestingly, no defect could be localized in the biliary duct cell system. Thus, our findings suggest that even when mtDNA is depleted in liver, the amount of depletion has to reach a critical threshold in single cells in order to express the biochemical defect and this may be variable within single cells. Thereby, similar to the skeletal muscle [45, 46] a mosaic defect pattern may result [63]. In the skeletal muscle 0.01 mtDNA/µm3 has been found sufficient for residual cytochrome c oxidase activity [46]. Therefore, a slight increase in the mtDNA copy number might be enough to traverse the threshold value to regain the normal respiratory function. This observation may open new possibilities for further therapy trials and may explain the occasionally observed reversibility of mtDNA depletion [47–49]. The mechanisms, however, underlying the expression of tissue selectivity and the reversibility remain still unclear [50, 51].",0.0

"The index patient reported here displays a rather unique phenotype of adult-onset Alexander disease. First, his age at onset was 50 years, which is one of the latest ever reported.3 Second, his clinical presentation was dominated by the combined presence of slowly progressive cerebellar and sensory ataxia, in the absence of palatal tremor. The kyphoscoliosis and his knee-bent posture are very likely related to his Alexander disease, as these features have been observed previously.4–13 Yet, the interval to the onset of ataxia in our case is remarkable. Third, neuroimaging in our patient revealed cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord atrophy—all previously reported imaging features of Alexander disease— but the white matter changes were extremely subtle, involving a minor portion of the anterior poles of both temporal lobes only. MRI abnormalities in adult-onset Alexander disease are heterogeneous, but the white matter changes are generally less extensive compared with the classic early-onset disease.17",1.0

"stantia nigra and no lesions or signs of demyelination elsewhere in the brain; thus, it was conﬁrmed that damage to the substantia nigra alone could produce clinical features of PD. Although several viruses are known to cause Parkinsonism,1 it is uncommon that a virus could have produced lesions predominantly in the substantia nigra and have caused reversible Parkinsonism. Such selective lesions have demonstrated with toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).2 However, the current study demonstrates the capability of a virus to do so. Hsieh et al.3 reported the case of a boy who presented with reversible Parkinsonism as the major symptom of EBV encephalitis. Brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed diminished perfusion in the region of the right caudate nucleus and no abnormalities in substantia nigra. Roselli et al.4 also reported a case of reversible Parkinsonism associated with EBV encephalitis and antineuronal antibodies detected in a human neuroblastoma cell line, which suggests that an autoimmune mechanism may play an important pathophysiological role. However, MRI showed no abnormalities in substantia nigra in these 2 cases, which was different from our case. Our observation indicates a direct acute neurotropic effect of EBV on nigral dopaminergic cells. The patient showed a substantial response in the acute phase to dopaminergic medication. During the treatment, this patient did not develop L-dopa–related dyskinesias or wearing off. We will follow this patient to observe whether she develops PD later.",1.0

"and ptosis appeared in her 3rd decade, and a second one in which obsessive disorder developed some years later, followed by cognitive decline and parkinsonism, in her 6th decade. It has to be admitted that although all these clinical manifestations can be explained by the genetic variant we report, the lack of genetic study in the sibling with a similar clinical picture or in any other relative (she only has a healthy sister who has declined to be studied) impedes to assess the segregation of this clinical picture. In addition, parkinsonism could be a coexisting condition, particularly if we consider the prevalence of this entity at the age of our patient. Be that as it may, similarly to the patient we describe, it has to be noticed that in contrast to typical PD, parkinsonism associated with POLG1 mutations has additional features, accounting for a more complex clinical phenotype and departing from a diagnosis of PD. On this regard, cognitive impairment is a particularly interesting feature as it is observed in other mitochondrial disorders [21,22], suggesting that the complexity of its pathogenesis extends beyond the dopaminergic system.",1.0

"Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) (OMIM 203700) is a rare autosomal recessive disease associated with mitochondrial (mt) DNA depletion and mutations in the POLG gene. AHS is usually characterized by a clinical tetrad of psychomotor regression, intractable epilepsy, cortical blindness and liver disease in infants and young children (Harding, 1990; Naviaux and Nguyen, 2004; Kurt et al., 2010). Replication of mtDNA involves a complex machinery called mtDNA replisome including the mtDNA polymerase γ (pol γ) and the Twinkle helicase (Farge et al., 2007). It was established that the holoenzyme pol γ is a heterotrimer consisting of one catalytic POLG1 subunit and a homodimer of the POLG2 accessory subunit (Yakubovskaya et al., 2007). Recently, the crystal structure of the human holoenzyme pol γ has been reported, providing a structural basis for understanding interactions between catalytic and accessory subunits (Lee et al., 2009).",

At the age of 1 year and 6 months, the patient showed better head control, and he started picking up objects; dyskinetic movements were still present, while peripheral hypertonia and brisk deep tendon reﬂexes decreased notably (Video 2). The low CSF HVA concentration together with the clinical improvement led us to hypothesize a primary neurotransmitter synthesis defect, but tyrosine hydroxylase gene study showed no mutations. When uric acid metabolism was assessed again, the patient presented a serum urate value of 463 lmol/L (normal range: 100–330 lmol/L), urinary uric acid/creatinine ratio at 2.32 mmol/mol creatinine (normal range: 0.2–2 mmol/mol creatinine), and markedly elevated renal excretion of xanthine and hypoxanthine. HPRT activity in hemolisate was undetectable, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity was elevated (59 nmol/hour/ mg hemoglobin; normal range: 19–38 nmol/hour/mg hemoglobin). Molecular analysis disclosed a 5-bp deletion in HPRT exon 3, corresponding to position 261– 265 of HPRT mRNA, associated with a 12-bp insertion in position 261.

The genotype can vary, but most cases of Alpers syndrome carry either of the two linker mutations A467T or W748S, in compound heterozygous with another POLG1 mutation (Nguyen et al. 2005). Recent crystallization of POLG has shown that the W748S mutation is located in a globular subdomain of the linker region, which contacts the primertemplate DNA complex to promote intrinsic processivity of POLG (Lee et al. 2009; Falkenberg and Larsson 2009).",

"Polymerase γ (POLG) is the enzyme responsible for the replication and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations in the POLG1 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, producing a wide range of neurological and non-neurological phenotypes. Neurological manifestations include ataxia, muscular weakness, epilepsy, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ptosis, neuropathy, psychiatric disorders and, more rarely, parkinsonism. We present the case of an 80-year old female patient with a history of PEO, ptosis, childish behaviour, obsessive disorder, cognitive decline, and parkinsonism. A comprehensive study showed striatal dopamine deﬁciency on DaT Scan and ragged red ﬁbres as evidenced by Gomori staining in a biopsy of the biceps brachii.

"Our results conﬁrm the validity of Vim DBS for drug refractory OT.2,3 The reduction in the amplitude of tremor indicates a role of the Vim in the genesis of OT but the lack of effect in the frequency suggests other generators. The greater amplitude of the patient tremor with the eyes closed compared with the eyes opened in OFF and ON stimulation points to the involvement of somatosensory inputs and may explain the degree of postural instability. At this respect, Wu et al.5 discarded the possible effect of vestibular afferents and suggested the posterior fossa as the origin of tremor. Another factor inﬂuencing the stability when walking during OFF stimulation may be the tremor frequency found during the phase of contact and the irregular activation of the tibialis anterior during the phase of swing.",

"Abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) produces debilitating motor abnormalities that are poorly responsive to medical therapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteroventral globus pallidus internus (GPi) may offer a treatment option for patients with diskinetic phenotype and minimal cognitive impairment, but its role in the management of HD remains unclear and to date only two cases have been reported. We report the outcome of GPi-DBS in a 72year-old man with HD. Stimulation at 130 Hz caused a rapid amelioration of chorea producing the worsening of bradykinesia, whereas 40 Hz stimulation (maintaining constant the total electrical energy delivered) improved chorea while preserving the ability to walk. At 1-year follow-up, chorea has completely disappeared; however, the patient was unable to stand and walk. The cognitive proﬁle showed a progressive deterioration, with an extension of deﬁcit from the mainly dysexecutive alterations at baseline to a more diffused cognitive deterioration. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of NMS in HD with aripiprazole treatment. The application of conventional clinical doses of aripiprazole, such as in our case, leads to a nearly complete saturation of D2-like dopamine receptors.7 High dopamine D2 receptor afﬁnity has been suggested as one of the bases of NMS, particularly of note when adding aripiprazole to other dopamine-receptor antagonists3 as in our case. Blocking striatal and hypothalamic dopamine transmission may have contributed to muscular rigidity and dysfunctional thermoregulation.7 Although a polypharmacologic cause of NMS has to be considered in our patient, the proportionally low afﬁnity of tiapride and melperone to D2-like dopamine receptors suggests that aripiprazole may have been the main culprit. In conclusion, when using aripiprazole in HD one needs to be aware of the risk for NMS, in particular, if patients take other dopamine-receptor antagonists.",

"Not only processing, but also interpretation of morphological findings in mitochondriopathies is difficult because the histological and histochemical features are not entirely specific. Separating primary from secondary abnormalities of mitochondria implies integrations of the morphological findings in the clinical picture.

A study found mitochondrial dysfunction in one third of patients with epilepsy that underwent metabolic testing [5], emphasizing that drugresistant seizures are a frequent problem in mitochondrial disease, and that new treatments need to be developed. In a previous case report, focal seizures in a patient with POLG-related mitochondrial disease ceased after two weeks of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [6]. Since these seizures are often refractory to medical treatment and the technique is non-invasive, we tested tDCS using similar parameters as in Ng et al.

Dorsal root ganglion cells were reduced in number and size with evidence of dropout and ongoing degeneration. Clarke’s nucleus also showed loss of large neurons and reduced size and numbers of residual neurons. However, spinal cord involvement (dorsal column and dorsal spinocerebellar tract degeneration) has been noted in patients with mitochondrial cytopathy with ataxic neuropathy and PEO [10].

Comment,
"POLG mutations have a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and age of onset. Liver, brain, and muscle are most commonly affected. At least six distinct phenotypes are recognized: (1) myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS); (2) Alpers syndrome; (3) ataxia neuropathy spectrum; (4) myoclonus epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia; (5) autosomal recessive progressive external opthalmoplegia; and (6) autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia.1 The MCHS phenotype describes the clinical picture of our patient (infantile presentation of hypotonia, myopathy, developmental delay, encephalopathy, and liver dysfunction) and is the form of POLG disease with the earliest age of onset.1 MCHS can be distinguished from the more common Alpers syndrome by the lack of seizures, liver pathology, and more severe myopathy.3 MCHS disease has also been attributed to other mitochondrial gene mutations, not solely POLG mutations.3",
"The FOXG1 mutation was absent in her mother but its de novo origin could not be ascertained, because of the father’s death. However, its causative role is highly probable: (1) it lies in the functionally critical DNA-binding forkhead domain of the protein; (2) it involves a residue highly conserved in different species; and (3) it was never found in 200 control females.",
"This family shows typical clinical features of PNKD.1,2 All patients showed a typical pattern and duration of the episodes, not activated by movement, and showed normal neurological status between attacks except for the oldest living individual (II:3) who developed late-onset postural and kinetic tremor, responding to alcohol intake. Individual I:1 who experienced a single attack at age 75 years related to febrile illness, was considered as probably affected, considering the transitory nature of his manifestation and the fact that fever was a precipitating factor also in other affected members, as reported in PNKD.6 The course of the disease was relatively benign and affected individuals achieved spontaneous remission or continued to have about yearly episodes without treatment. Mutations in MR-1, the only gene associated with familial PNKD,3,7 were excluded.",
"Indeed, the most distinctive feature in our family was the ﬁnding of symmetrical intracranial calciﬁcations, primarily affecting the basal ganglia, which has been previously reported in few isolated cases.8–11 Hereditary brain calcinosis may be found in several different conditions,12 for example, disorders of parathyroid hormone or calcium regulation, mitochondrial diseases, and defects of organic or amino acid metabolism. However, all these aetiologies were ruled out in our family. Linkage to 14q, described in families with Fahr disease and neurological symptoms,5 was excluded, conﬁrming that this condition is genetically heterogeneous.13,14 Moreover, the pathogenetic role of calciﬁcations remains unclear as the youngest patient showed unremarkable neuroimaging despite full phenotypical presentation. Identiﬁcation of further families could shed light on the pathogenesis of PNKD.",

"Previous reports have stated that odor discrimination improves after STN-DBS in PD patients, while olfactory detection threshold does not. These results suggest that STNDBS might modulate cognitive processing of olfactory information.5 The return to hyposmia after the stimulation was turned off, favors the hypothesis that functional changes in striatum-thalamus-cortical networks, rather than irreversible degeneration of olfactory structures only, are responsible for OD observed in PD patients. The progressive neuronal loss throughout the brain generates dysfunction in the chronometry of circuits of the basal ganglia affecting different systems interpreted clinically as various symptoms of PD. Once the hyper activation of STN is reversed by the onset of local electrical stimulation, its inﬂuence spreads out to other neural circuits correcting dysfunctions of modulatory neurotransmitters, which in turn is related to the temporary improvement of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although data in previous studies6 suggest that the motor effect obtained by dopaminergic medication and by STN stimulation shares the same activated brain areas, this is not likely to happen with olfactory function because dopaminergic reposition has no effect on hyposmia.1",

In case of a familial PAPT, the differential diagnosis is quite limited and, in addition to Alexander disease, also includes SCA20 and perhaps other forms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.15,16",
"logical properties of the GPi with reduced GPi ﬁring rates and abnormal bursting discharge.12 Modulation of the pathological activity within the GPi by means of DBS immediately reduces dyskinesias irrespective of the medication state.13 In contrast, intervening within the STN probably does not directly ameliorate L-dopainduced dyskinesias but rather exerts its antidyskinetic inﬂuence by postoperative reduction of dopaminergic medication.13 The superior effect of GPi-DBS compared to STN-DBS in reducing OFF-period dyskinesias, unrelated to external dopamine application, supports this concept assigning a pivotal role to the direct pathway in mediating dyskinesia-related neural activity. Alternatively or complementary to the proposed systemic effects on neural activity within the basal ganglia loop, differential effects of STN-DBS versus GPi-DBS14 on striatal dopamine release may impact the different outcomes in our patients. However, in contrast to the results of aforementioned animal studies, a PET study in PD patients with STN-DBS failed to detect any signiﬁcant change in the extracellular striatal concentration of dopamine.15",

"Mitochondriopathies are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases of all ages, with a very diverse clinical presentation related to genetic heteroplasmy. The clinical symptoms display a large variability and generally, the more severe phenotypes have an early onset, even from the neonatal period, while milder ones are manifested later in the adulthood. Most publications have already demonstrated deletions or point mutations in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), but in recent years, the field of investigation has expanded to syndromes caused by mutations in the nuclear DNA (nDNA), with a Mendelian inheritance. We present the case of a male patient with a mitochondriopathy with phenotype of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), due to an autosomal dominant mutation in nDNA, in the DNA polymerase subunit gamma (POLG) gene, the pathogenic variant c.2864A>G (p.Tyr955Cys), morphologically investigated and diagnosed using a skeletal muscle biopsy. The aim of this presentation is to emphasize the diagnostic value of the muscle biopsy both in cases of clinical suspicion and in more challenging cases of mitochondrial diseases with atypical or unusual features. Although genetic testing may be the initial test of choice in cases with suggestive clinical presentation, muscle biopsy is an alternative diagnostic aid with high value even in our molecular era. We present pathological and ultrastructural data to confirm the diagnosis.",

"case complex IV was the most vulnerable as seen in other MDDS.10 The finding of normal muscle histochemical and OXPHOS activities emphasised the need to investigate several primary tissues as muscle analysis in the present case, gave misleading results. In the present patient under IV glucose and frequent feedings with LCT, we found a severe hepatic dysfunction including cytolysis, cholestatic jaundice, ascites like in long chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogensase (LCHAD), while MCT dietary fat had a beneficial effect. In LCHAD deficiency, liver cirrhotic changes are presumed to be a toxic effect of the accumulating 3-hydroxy fatty acids.15 In the same way, in children harbouring POLG mutations, valproic acid which is a branched chain carboxylic acid has been reported as very hepatotoxic in AS.16 In some of the MDDS patients, an elevation of AFP levels can be a helpful diagnostic clue. In the present patient, AFP levels were initially markedly increased and subsequently returned to lower values (35.2 ng/ ml; normal: 0e15.0 ng/ml). Increased serum AFP level has been reported in DGUOK deficiency17e20 and in MVP17 deficiency.21 The genotype of the present patient has been reported in AS. Most of AS affected patients carry the linker p.Ala467Thr mutation mostly associated with p.Trp748Ser another linker mutation or p.Gly848Ser mutation located in the polymerase domain.2,5,6,22 In most patients with features of AS, the most prominent symptom is intractable progressive epilepsy, while hepatopathy develops later in the course of the disease.

Sequencing analysis with massive parallel sequencing of the coding exons and part of the flanking introns of the genes included in mitochondrial disease gene panel (target capture Roche) was performed. This mutation has been associated in literature with dominant PEO and PEO with Parkinson. Using genetic testing, the clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disease was confirmed, with the identification of an autosomal dominant gene defect in POLG. All siblings and children of this patient have an estimated risk of 50% to be affected. Genetic counseling of the patient is now essential.",
"The late onset of presentation of our patient as a consequence of his POLG1 mutations is of great interest. As is true of patients with the other phenotypes seen with POLG1 mutations, such as MIRAS, Alpers syndrome, and PEO, previously documented patients with SANDO have all generally presented before the ﬁfth decade of life. The reason for the delay in presentation in our patient remains uncertain. Both the p.T251I and p.P587L mutations are commonly seen in PEO; they usually present in cis, making it difﬁcult to conclude which is the pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic synergy likely exists between the two changes, resulting in the mutated protein being dominant to the wildtype protein. These same compound trans mutations, p.T2511/p.P587L, together with G848S, have been described in the severe form of POLG1 disease, Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome.2 The two mutations in cis, p.T251I/p.P587L, have also been demonstrated as homozygous mutations in a patient with encephalopathy and myopathy and in another patient with the p.T251I/p.P587L and p.L304R mutations that express encephalopathy and neuropathy.20 Currently, the reason for the diversity in phenotype expression remains unclear. Our patient represents a unique genotype for the SANDO presentation. His age of onset is highly unusual for mitochondrial disorders, suggesting that some other factor or factors, possibly environmental and/or genetic, account for the delay in presentation. However, his case demonstrates that, regardless of age, the prospect of a mitochondrial",

"Alpers syndrome is a disease in the severe end of the POLG disease spectrum, clinically characterized by intractable epilepsy, psychomotor regression, and hepatopathy, with or without liver failure (OMIM#203700). Additional symptoms such as ataxia, hypotonia, and cortical blindness are frequently seen (McFarland et al. 2008). Onset is usually in early childhood, although later forms exist (Uusimaa et al. 2008). Skeletal muscle is not always affected and a muscle biopsy often turns out to be normal in children with Alpers syndrome. Bicknese et al. described VPA induced liver toxicity in children with Alpers syndrome already in 1992. Since then, several cases have been reported, often with fatal outcome (Kayihan et al. 2000). The mechanism of VPA-induced liver failure in POLG disease is not clear; however, VPA is known to affect the mitochondrial respiratory chain function, among other ways by inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Silva et al. 2008).

However, mutagenesis in these conserved blocks ('Y3 and 'Y4) in drosophila protein seems to induce low DNA polymerase activity ('Y3 and 'Y4) and decrease of interaction with POLG-� subunit ('Y4) [31]. The strongest hypothesis during the initial diagnostic work up was that of a possible medium chain Acyl-CoA deficiency (MCAD). The clinical and laboratory picture of MCAD can initially resemble a mitochondrial DNA depletion and MCAD is by far more frequent than mitochondrial DNA depletion. Furthermore, normal lactate levels made unlikely the hypothesis of a mitochondrial DNA depletion. While waiting for the results of the Acyl-CoA tests, the child was put on continuous enteral feeding to avoid hypoglycaemia and further crises. Despite this, he developed severe episodes of hypoglycaemia and liver abnormalities. We believe that in this setting the recurrence of hypoglycaemia without fasting should have strongly induced the suspicion of a mitochondrial DNA depletion. This case is a further warning of the fact that even if this is a rare event it should be taken into account in differential diagnoses. A strong clinical suspicion could have accelerated diagnostic testing, particularly in the perspective of a possible emergency liver transplant. The issue of liver transplant in mitochondrial DNA depletion has been debated without a definite consensus [24,25,10]. The possibility of a multivisceral involvement (muscle, brain, heart) in the forthcoming years is an argument against transplant. In our case, the protracted lethargy accompanying the critical episodes could suggest possible future brain involvement",

"or without associated limb myopathy can be seen with both primary mitochondrial and nuclear DNA defects. Primary mtDNA defects can be due to point mutations or a single large mtDNA deletion. Among single large-deletion disorders, patients can have a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a pure myopathic presentation (i.e., pure PEO) to multisystem involvement as seen in Kearns-Sayre syndrome, with associated pigmentary retinopathy, hearing loss, short stature, or cardiac conduction abnormalities.9 A growing list of nuclear genes encoding proteins involved in maintenance, transcription, or translation of mtDNA have been reported in mitochondrial disorders, including POLG. POLG encodes the catalytic subunit of POLG, the sole DNA polymerase enzyme responsible for mtDNA replication and repair. Mutations in POLG can be associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from encephalopathy and epilepsy to sensory ataxia and myopathy, presenting from neonatal period to late adult life.10,11 From a myopathy standpoint, patients may present with PEO with or without an associated limb myopathy, in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. Patients may also present with limb weakness without extraocular muscle involvement.12 The 2 mutations detected in our patient have been described in association with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.13,14",

"Two years after the onset of jerking, routine EEG was normal. Median nerve sensory evoked potentials were normal. A jerk locked back averaged EEG did not show pre-movement cortical potentials. An order of activation study showed variable muscle activation, but the most frequent pattern of activation was caudal, from pectoral to abdominal muscles, with propagation estimated at 9 to 15 m/s. (see Figure 1) EMG burst length was between 50 and 150 milliseconds. DISCUSSION",
"DRS during single monopolar stimulation: severity of dystonia assessed by DRS 6–9 months after initiating single monopolar stimulation. Double monopolar stimulation: negative contact of standard stimulation mode and the adjacent (usually the more proximal) contact were programmed to negative and stimulated with the same pulse width, amplitude, and frequency. Interleaving stimulation: negative contacts of double monopolar stimulation were stimulated with different (their submaximal) amplitude values.",
Colonoscopy revealed colonic diverticulum. Abdominal computed tomography showed gastroduodenal expansion. Peripheral nerve conduction velocity findings were consistent with demyelinating and axonal sensory motor neuropathy. Protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was elevated (119 mg/dL; normal: 15–45 mg/dL) while no leukocytes were detected. The patient was initially diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and given corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. These treatments had no effect.,
"This boy was the ﬁrst child of healthy young unrelated French parents without relevant family history. At 16 months of age, he started a severe status epilepticus. CSF protein content was elevated (0.78 g/l; normal: 0.15–0.35). Cerebral MRI showed brain cortical atrophy with symmetrical thalamic T2 and Flair hyperintense signals associated with cytotoxic oedema within basal ganglia on diffusion sequences. Then, he developed intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with gener-",
"Due to the presence of multiple mtDNA deletions indicative of an mtDNA maintenance defect, polymerase 'Y (POLG1) gene amplification and sequencing was performed. This detected two previously described heterozygous mutations in compound p.T251I and p.P587L, frequently found in cis and subsequently confirmed as showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. No mutations were identified in the PEO1 (Twinkle) and SLC25A4 (ANT1) genes.",
"For the treatment of medication-refractory dystonia, bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) has proven to be an efﬁcient option. On average, 40%–55% improvement on dystonia rating scales (DRS) can be achieved according to the results of multicenter trials1–3 lasting for years.4 However, a considerable portion (10%–25%)1–3 of the patients experience minimal alleviation despite of good electrode placement. These patients can be regarded as nonresponders to GPi-DBS, deﬁned as having either limited improvement (<25% on DRS) or worsening. In addition to adjusting the amplitude, frequency, or pulse width of stimulation, the electrode conﬁguration from the commonly applied single monopolar stimulation mode (1 contact on the electrode is negative) can be changed to either double monopolar stimulation (2—usually adjacent—negative contacts on the electrode are stimulated with the same amplitude and pulsewidth values) or bipolar stimulation mode (1 contact on the electrode is positive) in case of unsatisfactory outcome.5 Although these techniques had been utilized in multicenter trials, nonresponsiveness to GPi-DBS did occur.2 In the present case series, we report that the recently introduced interleaving stimulation mode is superior to single or double monopolar stimulation in 4 patients.",

"A 40-year-old man presented with slowly progressive weakness and eyelid droopiness. His symptoms began in his early 30s as increased fatigue with exertion. In his mid 30s, he developed droopy eyelids without double vision. About 3 years before presentation, he started having progressive diﬃculty swallowing, initially with solid food but later with both solid and liquid consistencies. He also reported the food getting stuck in his throat. He had been treated for aspiration pneumonia once. A year later, he noticed slowly progressive limb weakness aﬀecting his hands and proximal lower limbs, described as diﬃculty holding a tablet at church, frequently dropping objects from his hands, and diﬃculty with standing up from a seated position. More recently, he started experiencing dyspnea on exertion and mild orthopnea. He occasionally experienced blurry vision without diplopia, mild head drop, and hoarseness of voice, mainly towards the end of the day or when he was tired. He was diagnosed with seronegative myasthenia gravis at a local facility, with negative acetylcholine receptor, muscle-speciﬁc kinase, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 antibodies. His medical and social history were otherwise unremarkable. The patient’s father was French Canadian. The patient also had Native American and African American ancestry. There was no family history of myopathy or any neuromuscular disorder. Neurologic examination was signiﬁcant for moderate bilateral ptosis, bilateral ophthalmoparesis with limited upward gaze and to a lesser extent horizontal gaze (both eye abduction and adduction), mild weakness of both upper and lower facial muscles, moderate weakness of the proximal lower extremities most prominent at the hip abductors (Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 3 to 4-/5), and mild (MRC grade 4) weakness of ﬁnger extensors and intrinsic hand muscles. He had no demonstrable fatigable weakness on examination in any of the aﬀected muscles. He had a mildly waddling gait and absent ankle jerks bilaterally. Sensory and coordination evaluations were unremarkable.",

"This woman presented in middle age with a progressive sensory ataxic neuropathy with later development of ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia and external ophthalmoparesis. No deﬁnite diagnosis was made prior to autopsy but a form of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy was favoured. Mitochondrial cytopathy was suspected in view of the previous changes of “ragged-red” ﬁbres and cytochrome oxidase-negative ﬁbres on two muscle biopsies performed 20 and 14 years prior to death.",
"facilities (respiratory chain enzymology and blue native gel electrophoresis) and molecular studies. With increasing availability and feasibility of genetic testing (gene sequencing – either single or panel testing using NGS), it is now becoming possible to confirm these diagnoses – to guide for further management of the child as well as for accurate counseling and prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies in the families. NGS helped in making diagnosis of MPV17-related mtDNA depletion syndrome in case 2, similar to reports earlier [5]. Awareness of these disorders is essential as there are no specific pointers other than raised lactate along with organ-specific dysfunction. An index of suspicion should be raised whenever any child is noted to have the constellation of symptoms of hepato-cerebral or myopathic form or even with isolated liver disease, along with positive family history or consanguinity. Accurate diagnosis can guide pedia-tricians for appropriate management and prognosis of the disease. In our cases, both children were candidates for liver transplantation, but diagnosis of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome with multiple organ involvement led to avoidance of the transplant. The decision of avoiding transplant was based on poor outcomes (55% mortality) and progression of disease post-transplant [6]. Patients with MDS also need to be advised against valproate therapy, as it may trigger a crisis and fulminant hepatic failure in children who may not have had hepatic involvement [7,8]. Prenatal diagnosis is now feasible in future pregnancies to rule out 25% risk of recurrence in siblings.",
